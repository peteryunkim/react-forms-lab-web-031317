## `PoemWriter`

1. Open the `components/PoemWriter.js` file.
2. You'll find one `<textarea>` in this component. Make this a controlled component by adding the necessary props to this element. Its value should be saved in the component's state.
3. You'll also find an error element in the markup. This element should _only_ be shown if the poem is not valid.
4. The rules for a valid poem structure are as follows:
    - The poem has three lines.
    - The first line has five words.
    - The second line has three words.
    - The third line has five words.
5. Be sure to account for users accidentally adding too many spaces! This means that `' I am a furry dog '` is a valid first line of the poem.
